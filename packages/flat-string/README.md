# Flat String

This function simplifies the complex C structures that are part of a combined JavaScript string.

If you're frequently combining strings and then using that combined string somewhere else, you might discover that running your string through `flatString` significantly enhances performance.

In simpler terms, `flatString` is a function that optimizes the way strings are stored in memory in JavaScript. When you concatenate strings, JavaScript internally creates a complex structure to save memory. However, when you need to use this string, for example, to write it to a file or send it over the network, this complex structure needs to be flattened, which can take time. By using `flatString`, you flatten the string right after concatenation, making the subsequent use of the string faster.

## Installation
